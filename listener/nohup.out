Added to clipboard history: ok how does this sound: I have a single binary called "clipboard" that takes cli arguments. When the name of the binary alone is entered it will display the clipboard list, If "clipboard --listen" is added the program will use go's exec lib to call "nohup clipboard --listen", starting the listener so the user is then free to call "clipboard" for opening the list as they please. Would there be a problem with the binary code calling a command to run itself?
