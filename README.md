## Future 
- rename config folder
- logging to txt file
- Implement runtime checker to determine wayland vs x11 and use xclip for img enabled
- Config added to json file, adjustable with CLI args
- Prevent duplicate clipboards being opened - would have to kill only the existing gui process

- Nix package
- Makefile installation

- Use with rofi front end? (Can add a section for this is readme but not essential) - Needs an arg to just list the history essentially 
- Paste option
