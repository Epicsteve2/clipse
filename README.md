## TODO
- update color settings with lipgloss
- trailing % on console logs
- code cleanup 
- logging to txt file - needed?
- Config added to json file, adjustable with CLI args
- Prevent duplicate clipboards being opened - would have to kill only the existing gui process
- README (with videos)

- Nix package
- Makefile installation

## Future Considerations
- Use with rofi front end? (Can add a section for this is readme but not essential) - Needs an arg to just list the history essentially 
- Paste option
