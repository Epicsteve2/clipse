## TODO
- Increased customisation to be made available
- Test -listen reliability and what makes it fail (log each step)

- README (with videos)
- Nix package
- Makefile installation
- blog posts

## Future Considerations
- Use with rofi front end? (Can add a section for this is readme but not essential) - Needs an arg to just list the history essentially 
- Sytem Paste option
- Extra config added to json file, adjustable with CLI args
- Better debugging? (currently can use > to a custom file)
- Use of a GUI library such as fyne/GIO
